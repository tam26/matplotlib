Pyber Trends:
1. This data shows that a majority of the rides/drivers are located in urban city types. Urban rides also account for a majority of the fares generated – 62.7% of the total fares to be exact.
2. While there are more rides in urban cities, the average fare of rides in rural cities is much higher, likely due to longer distance traveled between pick-up and drop-off spots.
3. It’s also clear when looking at the bubble chart that there is a direct correlation between demand (number of rides) and the number of drivers in a given city type.
